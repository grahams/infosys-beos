BeInfosys
Source Release Date 2/2/99

Here is the current snapshot of the BeInfosys source... I am providing it so people working on other clients can refer to this source to see how it works... 

Soco wrote most of the code in this client initially, in a mad rush, and I took it over from him towards the end....  

If you are planning on doing anything in Be with this source, please e-mail me/talk to me... I am dumping the current GUI altogether and working on a new LED sign based one... I figured I would release this working client before I went ahead and borked it all up.  If you have any questions, just mail me or hunt me down....

This source will be uploaded to the new Perforce version control server once it is set up.  For now, I am using RCS to maintain the version control..... Trust me, I hate RCS, but it does the job for now...
